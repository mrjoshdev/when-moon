# README

When Moon? is a cryptocurrency price tracker that interacts with an API pulled from www.coinmarketcap.com to provide up to date cryptocurrency prices displayed using a chart created using CSS.

Users can navigate to the index page where they are able to click on a 'Sign Up' link in the nav bar and are brought to a registration form.  After registering their account a user will be able to click the 'Add Cryptocurrency' button which will redirect them to an 'Add Cryptocurrency' form.  The user can then add the name, ticker symbol and target price of their chosen cryptocurrency and click 'Submit'.  The currency will then be added to a list on their user page, titled 'Captain's Page' in the nav bar, as part of a list.  On the user page the crypto can be edited by clicking on an 'Edit' button and updating the 'Add Cryptocurrency' form, the cryptocurrency can also be deleted on the user page by clicking a 'Delete' button.

Finally, the currencies are displayed on the index page using a custom chart made with CSS that displays the progress of each cryptocurrency on the user's list to their price target or 'Moon Price'.  When a 'Moon Price' rocket image appears along with flashing text that says 'MOON NOW!'
